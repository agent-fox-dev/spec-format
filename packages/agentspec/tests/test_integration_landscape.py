"""Integration and smoke tests for spec landscape awareness.

Covers:
- TS-01-26, TS-01-27, TS-01-28: integration tests for overlap detection
  LLM behavior (01-REQ-11.1, 01-REQ-11.2, 01-REQ-11.3)
- TS-01-SMOKE-1: end-to-end spec assess with landscape injection (01-PATH-1)
- TS-01-SMOKE-2: end-to-end spec refine with landscape injection (01-PATH-2)
- TS-01-SMOKE-3: graceful degradation when landscape loading fails (01-PATH-3)

Integration tests exercise the full pipeline with a mocked LLM client.
Smoke tests exercise the full SpecSession pipeline with real discovery/prompt
components and a mocked LLM.
