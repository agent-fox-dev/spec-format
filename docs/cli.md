# spec CLI Reference

The `spec` command is the CLI entry point for AI-powered spec creation. It manages the full lifecycle of creating, refining, generating, validating, and rendering specs. The binary is called `spec` and is installed via `install.sh` or built from `golang/cmd/spec-cli/main.go`.

## Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-d, --spec-dir PATH` | Spec directory (default: `.specs`). Can also be set via `SPEC_DIR` env var; CLI flag takes precedence. |
| `-s, --source PATH` | Source code directory for AI context during spec creation. Default: `.`. The path must exist on the filesystem. |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress progress output |
| `--version` | Show the version and exit |
| `--help` | Show help and exit |

```
spec [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [ARGS]...
```

## Commands

### new

Create a new spec from a PRD file. Auto-initializes the spec root directory and a default `campaign.yaml` if they do not already exist.

```
spec new [OPTIONS] SPEC_PATH
```

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `SPEC_PATH` | Path to an existing PRD file (required positional argument). The file must exist and must not be a directory. |
| `--name TEXT` | Snake-case spec name. When omitted, derived automatically from the PRD filename (CamelCase is converted to snake_case). Must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`. |

**Example:**

```bash
spec new docs/my-feature.md
spec new docs/my-feature.md --name my_feature
```

### list

List all specs in the spec root with their session states. Outputs a JSON object containing `spec_dir` and a `specs` array. Each entry has the directory name and the session state (or `"no_session"` if `_session.json` is absent or malformed). Always exits with status 0.

```
spec list
```

No additional options.

**Example:**

```bash
spec list
spec --spec-dir /path/to/specs list
```

**Output format:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "spec_dir": ".specs",
  "specs": [
    {"name": "01_my_feature", "state": "generated"},
    {"name": "02_auth_flow", "state": "assessing"}
  ]
}
```

### refine

Assess a PRD for quality and completeness, then iteratively refine it by answering questions.

Without `--answers`, runs the initial assessment and outputs pending questions as JSON. With `--answers`, submits answers, updates the PRD, and outputs the new assessment as JSON. Loop until the assessment quality reaches "ready", then run `generate`.

```
spec refine [OPTIONS] SPEC
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--answers TEXT` | Path to answers JSON file, or `-` to read from stdin. If the JSON has an `"answers"` key containing a map, the inner map is unwrapped automatically. |
| `--force` | Reset session to initial state, discarding all assessments, answers, and generated artifacts |

**Example:**

```bash
# Run initial assessment
spec refine 01_auth_redesign

# Submit answers from a file
spec refine --answers answers.json 01_auth_redesign

# Submit answers from stdin
echo '{"q1": "Yes, OAuth2 only"}' | spec refine --answers - 01_auth_redesign

# Force a fresh assessment
spec refine --force 01_auth_redesign
```

### generate

Generate JSON artifacts (`requirements.json`, `test_spec.json`, `tasks.json`) from an accepted PRD.

If the session state is `assessing` or `refining`, the PRD is auto-accepted before generation proceeds.

```
spec generate [OPTIONS] SPEC
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--force` | Delete existing artifacts and regenerate from scratch |

**Example:**

```bash
spec generate 01_auth_redesign
spec generate --force 01_auth_redesign
```

### validate

Run schema and cross-file checks on specs.

When `SPEC` is given, validates that single spec. When omitted, discovers and validates all specs in the spec directory. Validation checks required file existence (`prd.md`, `requirements.json`, `test_spec.json`, `tasks.json`), JSON well-formedness, and then runs library-level schema and cross-file validation.

```
spec validate [OPTIONS] [SPEC]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--cross` | Run cross-spec interface consistency checks (dependency graph validation and duplicate requirement ID detection) |
| `--short` | Condensed output: emit only `valid`, `error_count`, and `warning_count` -- no `errors` array |

**Example:**

```bash
# Validate all specs
spec validate

# Validate a single spec
spec validate 01_auth_redesign

# Include cross-spec checks
spec validate --cross

# Condensed output
spec validate --short 01_auth_redesign
```

### lint

Lint specs for validation errors and quality issues.

Discovers all specs in the spec directory and runs structural validation on each. By default, skips fully-implemented specs (all subtasks in `done` or `dropped` state). Also checks for empty JSON artifacts and missing `_session.json`.

```
spec lint [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--all` | Include fully-implemented specs in the lint run |

**Example:**

```bash
spec lint
spec lint --all
```

### render

Render a spec's artifacts as markdown or JSON for human review.

```
spec render [OPTIONS] SPEC
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--combined` | Combine all artifacts into a single document |
| `--json` | Output as JSON envelope (auto-enabled when `AF_AGENT=1`) |

Renders artifacts in canonical order: `requirements.json`, `test_spec.json`, `tasks.json`.

**Example:**

```bash
spec render 01_auth_redesign
spec render --combined 01_auth_redesign
spec render --json 01_auth_redesign
```

### status

Query session state for a spec (read-only). Reports the current lifecycle state, whether an assessment exists, and which artifacts have been generated.

```
spec status SPEC
```

No additional options.

**Output fields:** `ok`, `state`, `has_assessment`, `generated_artifacts`. Optional fields `last_error` and `quality` are included when present in the session.

**Example:**

```bash
spec status 01_auth_redesign
```

### campaign

Create a new campaign directory at the specified path, independent of the global `--spec-dir` option. Fails if `campaign.yaml` already exists at the target path.

```
spec campaign [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p, --path PATH` | Campaign directory path (required) |
| `-n, --name TEXT` | Campaign name (required) |
| `--description TEXT` | Campaign description |

**Example:**

```bash
spec campaign --path campaigns/q3-auth --name "Q3 Auth Overhaul" --description "Auth system redesign"
spec campaign -p campaigns/q3-auth -n "Q3 Auth Overhaul"
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success (or lint/validate found no errors) |
| `1` | Error or findings exist (e.g., lint/validate found problems) |
| `2` | Usage error (invalid arguments or missing required options) |

## Output Format

All commands emit JSON to stdout. Successful operations include `"ok": true` in the output. In agent mode (`AF_AGENT=1`), errors are wrapped as `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` on stdout. Outside agent mode, errors are printed to stderr.

The `render` command outputs raw markdown by default; use `--json` for JSON output.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **Required** for AI-powered commands (`refine`, `generate`). Anthropic API key used to call Claude for PRD assessment, refinement, and artifact generation. |
| `AF_SPEC_MODEL` | Override the default model tier or specify a model ID directly. Accepts tier names (`SIMPLE`, `STANDARD`, `ADVANCED`) or model IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`). Default: `STANDARD`. Also configurable via `config.toml` (see below). |
| `AF_AGENT` | Set to `1` to enable agent mode. Suppresses the banner, forces quiet output, and auto-enables `--json` for `render`. |
| `SPEC_DIR` | Override the default spec root directory (`.specs`). The `--spec-dir` CLI flag takes precedence over this env var. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` | Set to `1` to use Google Vertex AI as the Claude provider. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | Set to `1` to use AWS Bedrock as the Claude provider. |

### Configuration File

The `spec` CLI loads configuration from `config.toml`, searching in order:

1. `.specs/config.toml` (project-local)
2. `~/.specs/config.toml` (user-global)

The first file found is used. Symlinked config files are rejected for security.

```toml
[model]
model = "STANDARD"     # tier name or model ID

[provider]
auth_method = ""       # optional provider auth method
vertex_project = ""    # Google Vertex project ID
vertex_region = ""     # Google Vertex region
```

The `AF_SPEC_MODEL` environment variable overrides the `[model].model` value.

## Agent and Skill Workflow

The `spec` CLI is designed to be driven by AI agents. Two Claude Code skills orchestrate the spec creation workflow:

### PRD Authoring: the af-prd Skill

The `af-prd` skill (`/af-prd`) guides the user through creating a well-structured Product Requirements Document via an iterative interview. It operates as a Product Manager collaborator:

1. **Assess input maturity** -- classifies the starting material as Seed (vague idea), Sketch (rough bullets), or Draft (mostly complete).
2. **Analyze the codebase** -- reads project structure, README, existing specs, and steering directives to understand context.
3. **Draft an initial PRD** -- produces a first pass following the standard PRD structure (Intent, Goals, Non-goals, Functional Requirements, etc.), marking gaps with `[GAP]` placeholders.
4. **Interview loop** -- asks 3-5 questions per round across categories (intent, user stories, core behaviors, edge cases, error handling, technical boundaries). Maximum 5 rounds.
5. **Save the PRD** -- writes the finalized markdown file, ready to be passed to `spec new` or `/af-spec`.

The output is a raw markdown file (no YAML frontmatter) suitable as input to `spec new <path>`.

### Full Spec Workflow: the af-spec Skill

The `af-spec` skill (`/af-spec`) orchestrates the complete spec creation pipeline using the `spec` CLI:

1. **Understand the PRD** (Step 1) -- reads the PRD from a file path, GitHub issue URL, or user prompt. Identifies ambiguities, inconsistencies, and gaps, then resolves them with the user. Verifies external API assumptions against installed libraries.
2. **Learn the context** (Step 2) -- analyzes the codebase, existing specs, and cross-spec dependencies.
3. **Create the spec** (Step 3) -- runs `spec new <prd_path> --name <name>` to create the spec directory with a numbered prefix and initial `_session.json`.
4. **Refine the PRD** (Step 4) -- runs `spec refine <spec>` to get AI assessment, then iterates with `spec refine --answers <file> <spec>` until quality reaches "ready" (max 5 iterations).
5. **Generate artifacts** (Step 5) -- runs `spec generate <spec>` to produce `requirements.json`, `test_spec.json`, and `tasks.json`. Performs a post-generation language audit to ensure artifacts match the project's tooling.
6. **Architecture document** (Step 6) -- optionally creates `architecture.md` for complex designs.
7. **Validate and finish** (Step 7) -- runs `spec validate <spec>` (and `--cross` for multi-spec projects), fixes any issues, and reviews generated artifacts for quality.

### Session State Machine

Each spec maintains a `_session.json` file that tracks its lifecycle state. The state machine transitions are:

```
init --> assessing --> refining --> prd_accepted --> generating --> generated
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `init` | Spec created, PRD copied, no assessment yet |
| `assessing` | AI assessment of PRD quality in progress |
| `refining` | PRD is being refined through Q&A exchanges |
| `prd_accepted` | PRD quality accepted, ready for artifact generation |
| `generating` | Artifact generation in progress |
| `generated` | All artifacts generated and written to disk |

The session persists assessment history, QA exchanges, generated artifact names, and any last error. State transitions are written atomically using temp-file-and-rename.

Use `spec status <spec>` to query the current state at any time.

### AI Pipeline: SpecAgent

The `SpecAgent` (in `golang/agentspec/agent.go`) implements the three AI-powered pipeline stages that the session orchestrates:

**Model tiers.** The agent uses a tiered model system to select the appropriate Claude model:

| Tier | Default Model | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `SIMPLE` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Lightweight, cost-effective tasks |
| `STANDARD` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Balanced capability (default) |
| `ADVANCED` | `claude-opus-4-6` | Most capable, complex reasoning |

The tier is configured via `AF_SPEC_MODEL`, `config.toml`, or defaults to `STANDARD`.

**Stage 1: AssessPRD.** Sends the PRD text to Claude with a structured assessment prompt and a `submit_assessment` tool. The model evaluates PRD quality and returns an assessment containing a quality rating, summary, identified gaps, and clarifying questions. The spec landscape (sibling specs) is included as context to avoid duplication.

**Stage 2: RefinePRD.** Sends the PRD text along with user answers and the previous assessment to Claude with a `submit_prd_update` tool. The model rewrites the PRD incorporating the answers, then produces a new assessment. If the assessment is not included in the initial response, a fallback call retrieves it separately.

**Stage 3: GenerateArtifacts.** Sequentially generates three artifacts in order, each building on the prior ones:

1. `requirements.json` -- EARS-patterned requirements with correctness properties and execution paths
2. `test_spec.json` -- test contracts with full requirement coverage
3. `tasks.json` -- implementation task groups with traceability

Each artifact is generated via a dedicated `submit_{artifact}` tool call. After generation, the artifact content is validated for required keys (e.g., `spec_id`, `spec_name`, `requirements` for requirements.json). If validation fails, a **repair loop** sends the validation errors back to Claude for correction, up to 2 repair attempts per artifact. Temperature is set to 0.2 for deterministic output.

The `OnArtifact` callback writes each artifact to disk as soon as it is generated, enabling partial recovery if a later artifact fails. The session's `Generate` method skips artifacts that already exist on disk, allowing re-runs to resume from the point of failure.
